      "message": "Also, when I mentioned conflicts in the ticket / other packages where this change was made - it was because we\u0027re taking an existing app, and signing it with a different (our key). Keeping the same package name means app stores show it as installed but are unable to update, causing a conflict.\n\nChanging package name when changing the key like this / forking it avoids that.",
