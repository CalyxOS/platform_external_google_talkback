      "message": "That is true, and it\u0027s a good idea in general, but it\u0027s also unrelated to talkback, and more of a general thing. We\u0027re not providing help and feedback just for talkback, but for the entire OS.\n\nHaving something directly on device, separately, would be a good idea. The where and how are tbd. There may already be an issue about it.\n\nHaving it just in talkback but not anywhere else doesn\u0027t make sense for us, especially when we\u0027re handling everything in a central place, by the same people.\n\nThis change can go in now, a replacement if any later on can be added separately.",

      "message": "Not sure if this has further discussions yet. But agree that it is important for us to list our support/feedback channel for CalyxOS native interface. \n\nIs this something discussed with Aysha yet? A good way going forward would be having a checklist of everywhere it is currently listing Google Support (probably not very easy to find out?) that could give us some insights on deploying CalyxOS-native support/feedback channels throughout the OS. \n\nAysha and I discussed the comms channels and flows a little bit, but I believe it needs a more in-depth discussion with Nick/Chirayu\u0027s review. I\u0027m not sure where this is at in terms of priorities allocation. Perhaps Aysha has some updates?",
